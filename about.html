                    power couple building businesses together for almost two decades. Through their own experiences
                    overcoming poverty mindset, fear, limiting beliefs, self-doubt, anxiety and other similar success
                    blockers, they were able to achieve massive success personally and professionally. Through the
                    years, their passion for helping others achieve greater levels of Badassery grew, and they began
                    sharing their knowledge and experiences through various platforms, Personal Coaching and Public
                    Speaking. As the demand for this education increased, Badassery Factory was born.

                    <h3>Manufactures BADASSERY!</h3>
                    <p>Andre Popa was born in Romania under Communism. His family made the journey to America when he
                        was 9 years old with nothing but each other. No English, no money, no choice but to work hard as
                        a family to survive. His parents were both Electricians as their “assigned trade” back in
                        Communist Romania, so taking that skill set, they did whatever jobs they could find, and
                        eventually started their own company. After all, that was the “American Dream”!

                       

                        As a young adult, his entrepreneurial spirit was taking flight and he ventured out beyond
                        Electrical into Design & Construction. He quickly discovered he was a natural people person, and
                        his connecting skills, along with his extraordinary vision and unique designs landed him
                        multiple high-profile projects, including designing and building homes for several celebrities.
                        He had definitely found his niche in creating, building and connecting!

                        In 2000, he met Tami Popa, a kindred spirit. The only child of a single parent, she was no
                        stranger to tough times and hard work either. She started working at the age of 12, and never
                        stopped. Big dreams and a burning desire to change the course of her family’s financial future
                        led her down an entrepreneurial path. By the age of 19, she had found her niche in Network
                        Marketing and was earning a 5 figure monthly income! Andre and Tami quickly put their
                        entrepreneurial heads and hearts together, and through the years have built several successful
                        businesses, on top of raising two beautiful girls, now teenagers. They have never been satisfied
                        with the status quo, and constantly strive to achieve new levels of success, or as they like to
                        say … Badassery! It’s this mindset that sets them apart from the rest, and keeps them hustling.
                        In 2017, they transitioned out of their traditional businesses, to pursue their dreams and
                        passion projects. One of which was to take their years of experience as entrepreneurs, and
                        passion for teaching and helping others, to the next level. This was the launch of Badassery
                        Factory, a place where anyone from anywhere could go through the Factory and come out a BADASS …
                        In life, relationships and business! Today, Andre and Tami run their dream businesses from their
                        cell phones, inspiring and empowering others to unleash their inner Badass, and travel the world
                        with their girls! That is their “American Dream”!

                    </p>
                    <p> Andre worked along side his family as an electrician throughout his childhood, simultaneously
                        having side hustles of selling avocados, puppies, newspapers and whatever he could get his hands
                        on!</p>
